# dictforfun

this is a proof of concept project for:
- test how to ship a prebuilt sqlite database for android app
- test AutoCompleteTextView with dynamic query for items

there are 2 db file in extra_files, one small db with 1000 records for quick test. another one is full db, that might take a few second to load on first run. just copy each of them to res/raw folder and rebuild apk. don't forget remove old one in the folder.
